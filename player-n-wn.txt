Intestinal calcium absorption is increased after feeding a low calcium diet or under conditions of increased calcium needs, such as during growth, via a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D mediated process [ 3 ] . A lowering of serum calcium levels stimulates the secretion of PTH that then activates the renal conversion of inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active hormonal metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. At the intestine, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, acting through a nuclear receptor, stimulates transcription of vitamin D-mediated genes, including calbindin D, involved in calcium transport thereby acting as the primary hormonal regulator of active intestinal calcium transport [ 3 ] . It is thus likely that any putative key molecular <b>player</b> in calcium absorption, such as CaT1 or ECaC1, should be a prime target for hormonal regulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
