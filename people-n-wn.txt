These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their "rights" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to "hang [the child] from the highest tree".
Even if your "re-enactment" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview.
But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote "gun rights" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.
But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote "gun rights" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.
Did the 19th century NRA in the southern states promote gun rights for black people?
But why do people deal with drugs?
Once again, your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms Moore's (and Busch's) assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes.
This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong.
Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.
Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia.

One of the most prominent, lasting influences is that of the land grant system. Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.
In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.
The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity.
Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.
This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts.
Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people.
A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.
By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.
Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).
The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82).
This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other.
In the 1990s the rhetoric of "cultural diversity" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.
Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use.
A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture.
The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).
In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8).

Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5).

it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented -- in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like DDT have had on wildlife and people.
Thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you, Audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring -- but the USDA’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration, unless we act now.

Studies have shown that without light cues, totally blind people tend to have free-running circadian rhythms with an average period of 24.5 hours, instead of the usual 24.
The problem with this is that your sleep-wake schedule won't match up with that of the people around you, and if you need to be awake for breakfast at 7am or for a meeting in the afternoon, your sleep schedule may interfere.
As Ani Kunga explained, "Prayers, wishes, hopes, aspirations--someone, many people, may share those with you.
They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up.
They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up.
Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs.
The people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order.
As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself.
But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.
It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all, the sort of romance that sustains the hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love.
Moreover, he never did portraits of famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it.
He began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed.
In the wake of his departure, people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life, a corporate ‘road map’ to guide their destiny and the firm’s hierarchy to define their status or place in society.
Yet, despite the large amount of publicity generated as ‘organization man’ was shown to the door, a large proportion of people who participate in the work place, and even whole industries, never really played by the traditional rules anyway.
For these people and industries the ‘boundaryless career’ is simply business as usual.
In the absence of external guides, people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments.
That is, people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds.
People enact laws, which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour, leading people to enact new laws, and so on.
People enact laws, which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour, leading people to enact new laws, and so on.
People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system (Weick, 1979).
People join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour.
Moreover, people’s loyalty is not only to their profession, but to the host industry region.
People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings.
People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community.
In these meeting places, people gather to see old friends, gossip, and make new acquaintances.
As one engineer explained, the process is quite simple: ‘people rub shoulders and share ideas’ (Saxenian, p. 27).
As one engineer reported: ‘‘‘You don’t just hire people out of the blue.
In general, it’s people you know, or you know someone who knows them’’’ (Saxenian, p. 27).
As Jones’s (1996) research affirms, people’s social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry.
You have to find people you like who make movies . . . It’s getting the first job that is the hardest’’’ (Jones, 1996, p. 62).
It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills.
During this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry.
Once socialised, people engage in collective learning as they problem-solve on a project-by-project basis.
It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development.
It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others.
In ‘weak’ environments, in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled, both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty.
Left to its own means, however, agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform, the balance of power to be lost, and, most importantly, the trust and co-operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited.
Agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries, communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements.
Together, the combination of behaviours supports current high-technology or film-making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities.
Other kinds of community – stemming, for example, from shared ideological, family, educational, ethnic, or gender attachments – can also provide enduring support for people’s boundaryless career endeavours (Parker & Arthur, 2000).
Since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time, a balance of behaviours is required.
Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations.
Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations.
Traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards.
People are recruited to participate in high-technology and film-making projects for the skills that they bring – skills that have been developed from previous projects.
Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves?
Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust?
We have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished – reaping benefits for people, companies, and host industries alike.
People may not need to move between firms perpetually, but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas.

September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget.
Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster.
Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.
The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope.
Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level.
Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country.
They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.
As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region.
Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people.
The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive.
People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds.
People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general.
People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general.
Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.
People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did.
If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism.
This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.
People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.
Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist.
Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing.
In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride.
Black Monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people.
But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures.
Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities.
For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives.
Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children.

Yet people are always surprised.
Section 101(a) of Title 39 establishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation "to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people."
Although most people would describe this house as “traditional,” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style.
Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box—like most creative people, architects dislike being categorized.
First lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle .
The end result of such roundtables, one can only fear, could be that the only books depicting people of color that get published are those that do not challenge white assumptions.
"People will read such stories; they are worth publishing."

Some people say you can test the authenticity by touch — real jade feels smooth and cool.
Most famous is the striking 74-story I.M. Pei Bank of China Tower, not beloved by the people of Hong Kong — its triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui (see box, page 68) and its radio masts stick up like an insect’s antennae.
During the spring and autumn festivals, when people traditionally seek out the hilltops, the throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another time.
In the very early morning the park is taken over by people doing tai-chi exercises.
Aberdeen, the island’s oldest settlement, once a pirate lair, is home to the “floating population” — the boat people who spend their entire lives on the junks in the harbor, some proudly claiming never to have set foot on land (except for funerals, which don’t count).
There are fewer boats now than in the past; many boat people, especially the younger generation, have moved to housing projects.
From the ferry terminals on Hong Kong Island you can escape to islands without cars or cares, where the local people smile “hello” and, if you’re lucky, point you to a secret beach for the ultimate in quality leisure time.
The island’s largest community is Tai O. The people of this picturesque village make their living by fishing, duck-breeding, and food-processing.
More than 25,000 people live here, mostly by fishing, but there are also ex-pats, attracted by its laid-back Mediterranean ambience.
The people still carve jade and build seaworthy junks, all by hand.
The Barrier Gate (Portas do Cerco), which was built more than a century ago, marks the boundary between the enclave of Macau and the People’s Republic of China.
Ever since 1957 the Canton Trade Fair (officially the Chinese Export Commodities Fair) has attracted throngs of international business people every spring and autumn.
Guangzhou, like Hong Kong, is primarily Cantonese-speaking, but many people also speak Mandarin.
This enormous, modern version of a traditional Chinese building, with sweeping blue tile roofs, contains an auditorium big enough to seat 4,700 people.
A very popular day-trip from Guangzhou goes to Foshan, a city of nearly 300,000 people, renowned for its handicrafts for more than a thousand years.
And one we will keep for as long as there are people like you who care about our country’s wildlife and wild places.

I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.

He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.
One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.
The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.
It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.

As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.
Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world?
I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.
We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.
Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.
It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.
A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.
And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.
But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.
People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy.
I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.
He caused the death of so many people.
But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994.
So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?
But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.
During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.
The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that?
I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.
One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.
But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.
I want to empower the people.
I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.
I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.
The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.
But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.
And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.
I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.
People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.
They're tolerant people.
They're good, tolerant people.
And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.
I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.
And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.
I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.
I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.
I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.
But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.
But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.

That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.
The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.
Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.
Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.
I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.

Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.
These are places where people can get primary care.
It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.

It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.
I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.
So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.
You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.
We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.
We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.
Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.
The people of Texas.
And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.
And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.
And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.
Already people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.
Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.
The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.
And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.
People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.
I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.
So long as people have input.
People care about these things I've found out.
And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.
But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.
There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.
More sometimes than people in foreign countries.
But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.
That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?
This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.
By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.
I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.
Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight.
Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.
People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.
As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.
I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.
No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.
Flu kills thousands of people every year.
One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.
I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.
And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.

They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.
Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.
They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.
For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress.
And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.
Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.
We have more people who qualify.
I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.
I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.
I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.
But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.
You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.
You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.
But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.
And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.
I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.
People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.
But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.
People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.
Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.
You're also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital.
And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.
In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.
Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.
The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.
The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.
It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.
You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts.
I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.
Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.
And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.
You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.
I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.
Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.
People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.
People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.
I'm told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day.
Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know.
We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.
Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.
It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.
There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.
And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.
It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.
And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.
Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.
The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.
We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.
We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.
More people are dropping into poverty.
One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.
We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.
But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. "
In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.
And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.
That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.
Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.
I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith to the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.
The people I talked to their spirits were high.
I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.
I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.
I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.
And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.
Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.
And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.
And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.
If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?
But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.
I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.
But I'm mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not.
I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country.
I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself, as manifested in public policy through the faith-based initiative where we've unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt.
And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.
And people all find their ways to express it.
There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.
There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.
And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.

And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.

The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.
And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.
I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, "Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. "
I think people understand what she's saying.
Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.
And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.
And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.
A lot of people ask that, if they actually just wanna go there.
People come up to you on campus and say, "Where's the library?
People.
People have the same problem with my name.
Cuz you kn- When you said people have the same problem, I thought - Cuz my H_ goes after the uh e- e- e- the v-
