Like a thinking man's Johnny Apple, he surveys various Kennedy and Johnson hacks--even tracking down that <b>familiar</b> standby, the unnamed "Washington veteran"--and reaps a harvest of self-congratulatory harrumphing along the lines of "I come from an era when loyalty and gratitude were regally honored," not like these young whippersnappers, etc.
