This investigation, which applies similar methodology to smaller <b>window</b> sizes, concerns the intra-genomic homogeneity of dinucleotide relative abundance, and inter-sequence distance calculations are beyond its scope.
Overall, 84 modules or 58 % of the <b>window</b> 500 dataset are also among the top 200 of the <b>window</b> 700 set, and thus might be accorded more significance.
