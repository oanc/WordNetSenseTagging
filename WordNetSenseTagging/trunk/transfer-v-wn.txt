It should be noted that the fibroblast cells lines we used remain fully viable after detachment and <b>transfer</b> to suspension culture [ 31 43 ] . This is in contrast to most epithelial cells which undergo anoikis, i.e., apoptotic cell death after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions [ 45 ] . It is of interest that some anchorage-independent tumor cells, most of which are of epitheloid origin, <b>become</b> susceptible to anoikis after the introduction of exogenous PTEN [ 23 34 35 36 ] . These observations are in line with the established ability of PTEN to down-regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/PKB survival pathway [ 11 46 ] . The absence of anoikis in our two cell lines may reflect inherent cell type specific differences, i.e., the superior ability of fibroblasts to survive under suspension culture conditions.

In fact, there are few well-documented cases for the non-allelic relay of trans-silencing ability [ 11 24 ] . Does this amount to an operational difference between allelic (paramutation) and non-allelic (trans-silencing) interactions, or does it simply reflect a lack of data?

The G+C content of a genome and the codon usage of its genes are determined by selection and mutation pressures [ 1 ] . Because these evolutionary processes are characteristic of each species, the sequences belonging to a genome share a common pattern of composition of bases, codons and oligonucleotides [ 2 3 ] , making it possible to identify laterally <b>transferred</b> genes (LTGs) as those whose features are atypical for a particular genome.
Previous studies have shown that adoptively <b>transferred</b> tumor antigen-specific CD4 +T cells can be tolerized in the secondary lymphoid organs [ 9 34 ] , including the RIP-Tag2 model [ 30 ] . Radiation may kill or disable regulatory T cells [ 35 36 ] , or other bone marrow-derived tolerizing cells and prevent the induction of tolerance in adoptively <b>transferred</b> tumor-specific T cells [ 9 ] . Additionally, the high but sub-lethal dose of radiation used leads to significant lymphopenia [ 37 ] .
