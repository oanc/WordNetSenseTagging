Case-control studies are applicable with special considerations for cancer screening [ 22 ] . Periodic Screening Evaluation (PSE) is a method for using data from subjects of various age who receive at least two regularly scheduled screenings to estimate the reduction in cancer mortality from periodic screening over a range of ages [ 23 24 ] . The main assumptions of PSE are (1) once a cancer is detectable on screening it would be detectable on later screenings (2) given age, year of birth adds no information for predicting the detection <b>rate</b> on the first screen, (3) no selection bias in using refusers to estimate survival from detection in the absence of screening.

Prehn and West, using 1990 census data, calculated breast cancer incidence <b>rates</b> for aggregations of census block groups matched to Marin County on characteristics associated with higher breast cancer risk (percentage white population, urban status, average parity, median household income, percentage of persons with a college degree, percentage of persons with a working-class occupation, and percentage of households living below the poverty line), and found <b>rates</b> in the matched areas to be comparable with those in Marin County [ 4 ] . In another study using interview-based information, higher breast cancer incidence <b>rates</b> among white women in the SFBA were also fully explained by the distribution of parity, age at first birth, months of breast-feeding, age at menarche, and age at menopause [ 5 ] . Other previous analyses of nationwide variation in breast cancer incidence and mortality found most of it attributable to the distribution of known breast cancer risk factors [ 15 16 ] . It thus seems likely that a substantial part of the excess incidence observed in Marin County is explained by a higher concentration of women with a higher breast cancer risk profile.

Early studies indicated that depletion of amino acids and not other nutrients is essential for initiation of development [ 19 20 21 ] . Upon amino acid starvation, among other events there is a substantial decrease in the <b>rate</b> of initiation of protein synthesis, resulting in a reduction in size and amount of polysomes and accumulation of free ribosomes [ 19 22 23 ] . It is believed that the decrease in protein synthesis in response to starvation occurs post-transcriptionally, since adding back amino acids rapidly restores protein synthesis and does not require new mRNA synthesis [ 22 ] .

Wallace (1968) pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes.
The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault (20.3 mm/year, Brown and Wallace, 1968) and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault.

AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND TO ENTER INTO RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS
Report to the Congress on Authority of the United States Postal Service to Introduce Innovative Products and Services and to Enter into Rate and Service Agreements
In accordance with the direction of the Joint Committee of Conference concerning the 2002 appropriation for the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission hereby transmits its report on the scope of existing authority of the United States Postal Service under current postal laws and regulations to introduce new products and services and to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers.
The mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail services is the joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to adopt new mail classifications under 39 U.S.C. §§ 3623 through 3625.
The Postal Rate Commission has developed specialized procedural rules that provide for expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of other interested persons.
Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or "niche classifications" are rate and service adjustments arranged by the Postal Service and potential users that are legally permissible, provided that:
The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole; and
In joint deliberations on appropriations for the United States Postal Service and certain other agencies and departments for Fiscal Year 2002, the committee of conference directed both the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to prepare reports on particular areas of the Postal Service's authority under existing law.
…both the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to independently report, 90 days after enactment of this Act, on the scope of existing authority of the US Postal Service, under title 39, United States Code, and title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, to introduce and provide new products and services (including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market test basis) and to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers.
The first outlines the Postal Service's current legal authority to introduce new products and services, the role of the Postal Rate Commission in that process, and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited approval of such innovations.
The second section addresses the same topics in connection with Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs), so-called "niche classifications," which are special service and rate arrangements negotiated between the Postal Service and a particular mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to their use of the postal system.
Similarly, § 403(a) assigns the Postal Service the duty to "plan, develop, promote, and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates and fees."
B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department was codified as part of Title 39.3 The Reorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the Governors of the Postal Service establish, and the Postal Rate Commission reviews proposed changes in, the terms and conditions of postal services, which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (or "DMCS").
Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date.
The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service.
A joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.
The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services that would supplement, but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time.
Minor" classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service.
Conclusion: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons.
POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES
For a number of years, some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service.
Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications."
For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness.
No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users.
Section 401(3) of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into and perform contracts," and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed.
However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone.
From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the Reorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter 36 of Title 39.
These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service.
These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service.


In providing services and in establishing classifications, rates, and fees under this title, the Postal Service shall not, except as specifically authorized in this title, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails, nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user.
Sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity, together with other criteria, as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes.
Without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the Postal Service and a customer, there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied.
Regarding rates, § 3622(b)(6) establishes "the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service" as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change.
considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers.
Rate and service agreements negotiated by the Postal Service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the Postal Reorganization Act are satisfied.
In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the request of a mailer, the Commission addressed the question of the Postal Service's authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of a proposal to recognize "contract rates."
