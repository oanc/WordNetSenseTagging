Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder resulting in reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A [ 1 2 ] . This results in the systemic accumulation of D-galatosyl conjugates, particularly globotriosylceramide (Gb3) [ 3 4 ] . Although the disorder is heterogeneous, patients suffer renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications [ 4 ] . Enzyme replacement therapy has recently shown to have an effect on resting cerebral blood flow abnormalities and on other organ systems functions [ 5 6 ] . In the cerebrovascular system there is an increased incidence of stroke together with vessel ectasia [ 7 ] . This may be related to the progressive accumulation of storage material in the cerebral vessel or possibly, may be due to an abnormality of vessel function [ 8 9 ] . The cerebrovascular complications are distributed predominantly in the posterior circulation with a progressive increase over time in the posterior distribution of small vessel disease as found on T 2 -weighted <b>images</b> or fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR [ 7 10 11 ] . It likely that such high signal lesions on MR <b>images</b> represent ischemic small vessel disease, however, there are no neuropathological-radiological correlative studies confirming this assumption.

Although the cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined, it is now clear that zeiosis is associated with apoptotic cell death (for review [ 24 30 ] ). In static <b>images</b>, the morphological changes associated with apoptosis appear as membrane blebs covering the surface of the cells [ 31 32 33 ] . However, time-lapse <b>images</b> reveal that blebs protrude and retract in a dynamic fashion, a hallmark of zeiosis [ 22 23 ] . Dynamic membrane blebbing appears to involve a dramatic change in the cytoskeleton and may be induced by a caspase-3-mediated cleavage of ROCK-I, a Rho-activated serine/threonine kinase known to stimulate actinomycin-based contractions [ 31 32 33 ] . A similar profile can be seen in the videos of MTX-induced cell death in the presence of U73343 ( Files 2 and 3 ). The cells first <b>lose</b> adhesion to the coverslip, retract and roundup.

The resulting sequences were annotated with similarity information and sequence quality information and submitted to dbEST.
