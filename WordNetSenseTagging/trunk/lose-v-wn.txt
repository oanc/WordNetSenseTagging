Accordingly, poly(A) sites are not efficiently recognised when positioned between 5' and 3' splice sites [ 38 39 ] , and insertion of a 5' splice site into a 3' terminal exon suppresses polyadenylation [ 40 42 ] .

We find that the proximal hnRNP A2/B1 exon upstream of the provirus does not <b>lose</b> its identity; rather, the exon splices either to the Neo splice site or to the next hnRNP A2/B1 exon.

Since S. pombe contains only three chromosome pairs, aberrant assortment during one or both of the meiotic divisions can produce, by chance, a significant fraction of meiotic products that receive at least one copy of each chromosome and are hence viable [ 38 43 ] . Aberrant segregation can also produce nullisomic aneuploids (missing one or more chromosomes), polysomic aneuploids (having additional copies of individual chromosomes), and diploids [ 38 39 44 ] . In S. pombe the haploids and diploids are viable, nullisomic aneuploids are inviable, and disomic aneuploids tend to <b>lose</b> the extra chromosome or chromosomes and become haploid [ 45 ] . We therefore determined the frequencies of spore viability and meiotic diploidy as genetic measures of chromosome segregation errors.

The strain used in this study, AD169, and the Towne strains were both used to develop vaccines [ 49 ] . Differences in infectivity have been observed between 2 of the same strains of CMV and this may be attributed to the deletion or mutation of certain tropism genes upon extensive serial propagation [ 50 51 ] . Clinical isolates (wild-type CMV) can carry more than 220 genes, and some of these genes can be <b>lost</b> by deletion and/or rearrangement during laboratory passage [ 50 ] . The AD169 strain used in this study has been passaged many times and because of these variations observed among the CMV strains, this may partly account for the low infectivity observed in the BJAB-B1 and P3HR-1 cells.
