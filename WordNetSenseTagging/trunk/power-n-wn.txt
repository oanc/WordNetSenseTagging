The relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels, as related to relative sediment size, load, velocity of flow, and stream power, are also indicated in Figure 2.2.
It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient, sediment load, stream power, and the type of sediment load transported by the channel (Schumm and Kahn, 1972).
The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power, gradient, and sediment load (Schumm and Kahn, 1972).
Sediment load, stream power, velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables (from Schumm and Khan, 1972).
Figure 2.4 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope, stream power and sediment load for each channel type.
The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load, but within each type, the different patterns reflect increased valley slope, sediment load, and stream power.
Ware’s experiments showed that a sinuosity increase, which resulted in a slope decrease, was only part of the adjustment, and width, depth, and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power.
Micro-level activities gather the force and the power to shape macro-level processes and larger institutions.
Left to its own means, however, agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform, the balance of power to be lost, and, most importantly, the trust and co-operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited.
Thus, the President directed EPA to propose legislation that would significantly reduce SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions from power generation through a cap and trade program.
The more I learn about the cost and inefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to which power generators will be subjected if we do not have new legislation, the more I am convinced that we can --and must -- develop a smarter approach that protects the environment and public health while reducing the cost to consumers and industry and optimizing the size of both the state and federal government machinery necessary to achieve that protection.
Significant cost savings can be achieved for power generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative package.
I look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce emissions from power generation.
We are concerned that S. 556's short timeframes for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken off-line at important times, which could lead to electricity shortages.
Compliance with the program has been nearly 100 percent and annual emissions of SO2 from power plants have already been reduced over 6 million tons (about 35 percent) from 1980 levels.
Despite the significant progress we have made under the Clean Air Act, air emissions from power generators are still contributing to serious public health and environmental problems.
Fine particles formed from power plant emissions as well as mobile source emissions are of
EPA, states, and industry, working together, have made important strides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion by the electric power industry since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970.
Despite significant improvements in air quality throughout the country however, emissions from power generation continue to result in serious health, environmental and economic impacts.
In 1999, the electric power industry was responsible for 67% of sulfur dioxide emissions, 25% of nitrogen oxide emissions, and 37% of mercury emissions in the United States.
The President's flexible, market-based approach to reducing emissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the complex web of existing regulations which currently confront the industry.
There are many regulations in place that will reduce air emissions from electric power generation.
But the regulation of power generators does not end with existing regulations.
It is expected that the existing fine particle and ozone standards now in place will also result in further regulation of power generators.
Because states and EPA will have to find some way to significantly reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, it is probable that power generators will be required to reduce their emissions significantly.
Power generation accounts for a significant percentage of these emissions, and our analysis shows that there are significant reductions available at lower cost than from other sources.
Additionally, states know that if they do not get the reductions from power generators, they will have to impose significant reduction requirements on other local industrial and commercial sources or impose local transportation control measures.
They will be reaching out to control power generators and large industrial facilities in other states because transport from other states contributes to both ozone and fine particle pollution in many areas.
This one-at-a-time, uncoordinated series of regulatory requirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for the environment, the power generation sector, or American consumers.
This one-at-a-time, uncoordinated series of regulatory requirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for the environment, the power generation sector, or American consumers.
It would provide power generators with more certainty about their regulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions about investments in new technology, which would improve energy security.
It would establish national cap-and-trade programs for NOx, SO2 and mercury emissions from power generators (with appropriate measures to address local concerns).
Such an approach will benefit the power generation industry, the economy, and the states, while improving public health and the environment.
Integration, advance knowledge, and certainty regarding environmental requirements will have even greater value over the coming decade as the electric power industry undergoes further structural changes.
9 efficiency/energy intensity of the electric power industry
We share the desire expressed in S. 556 to significantly reduce and cap emissions of SO2, NOx and mercury from power generation.
We have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coal-fired power plant would be able to achieve 90% source-specific controls for mercury by 2007, without considerable fuel switching, which would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy security.
We are also very concerned about the "outdated power plant" provision.
Layering additional requirements, such as the "outdated power plants" provision, on top of a cap and trade program is very likely to increase costs without providing significant environmental benefits.
For example, depending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress, this type of legislation would obviate the need for Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements, mercury MACT, and new source review case-by-case technology requirements for power generators.
Additionally, as Governor Whitman said when she testified before you in July, including CO2 in this bill will slow down, if not prevent, the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to control multiple emissions from power plants.
We appreciate the role of S. 556 in generating important discussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to controlling emissions in the power sector.
