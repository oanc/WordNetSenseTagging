On hatching from the eggshell, L2 worms are able to locate and migrate towards a potential host plant, penetrate the root behind its tip in the zone of elongation, and migrate intercellularly through the vascular cylinder by separating cells at the middle lamella [ 4 ] . The migration is enabled by a combination of stylet protrusion (mechanical <b>force</b>) and secretion of cell-wall-degrading enzymes from specialized glands [ 5 6 7 8 ] . Upon completion of migration, secretions from the nematode's glands, and potentially other cues, induce root cells to alter their development and gene expression, undergoing abnormal growth and repeated endomitotic rounds of replication to form a feeding site made up of giant cells [ 9 10 ] . The L2 feeds from the giant cells for 10-12 days, then ceases feeding and molts three times over the next two days to form the adult.

Cyclic nucleotide induced relaxation is associated with phosphorylation of heat shock protein 20 (also known as HSP20 or P20) on serine 16 [ 10 11 12 ] . More recently, ser 16-HSP20 phosphorylation was shown to specifically and temporally correlate with "<b>force</b> suppression" rather than the "deactivation" form of relaxation [ 8 10 ] . A region of HSP20 (residues 110-121) has sequence homology with troponin I; peptides from this region bound thin filaments, reduced actin activated myosin S1 ATPase activity, and relaxed skinned swine carotid artery [ 10 ] . We hypothesized that binding of ser 16-phosphorylated HSP20 to the thin filament may "turn off" thin filaments so that phosphorylated myosin does not interact with the thin filament (i.e.
