The concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has recently evolved [ 1 2 ] . Lung fibroblasts respond, in vitro , to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [ 2 3 4 ] . In addition, activated lung fibroblasts have been <b>shown</b> to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in vitro , and hence, these cells may also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [ 1 2 ] . This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating the fibrotic process [ 2 ] .
Of course, the paper should have mentioned that this hardly counts against the idea of streamlining bureaucracy--it only <b>shows</b> that not all reinventions are equally good ones.

Subsequently, sequence analysis identified KRC as a member of the ZAS family of proteins which share the ability to bind κB-like motifs [ 15 ] . DNA competition analysis <b>showed</b> that KRC fusion proteins containing the ZAS-C domain bind specifically to both the RSS and to the κB motif [ 14 28 ] . DNA footprinting analysis further <b>showed</b> that KRC/ZAS-C binds to specific nucleotides within the κB and the heptamer of the RSS [ 14 ] . In this study, using a PCR-based DNA-binding site-selection and amplification procedure, we demonstrated that both the N-terminal ZAS-N and the C-terminal ZAS-C domains are able to bind GT-rich DNA sequences, and confirmed that the RSS and κB motifs are the high-affinity targets of KRC.

We have <b>shown</b> that α-actinin is abundant in the bone marrow stroma matrix, presumably at focal adhesion sites [ 5 ] . We have also reported that a 31 kDa amino-terminal α-actinin fragment, which we have named mactinin, is generated by the degradation of extracellular α-actinin by monocyte-secreted urokinase [ 6 ] . Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mactinin is present in inflammation caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with infection [ 6 ] . It was not present in mice not challenged with P. carinii , suggesting that inflammaton is necessary for mactinin formation.

Autoantibodies directed against the Golgi complex were first identified in the serum of a Sjögren's syndrome patient with lymphoma [ 1 ] . Subsequent reports described anti-Golgi complex autoantibodies (AGA) in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [ 2 ] , rheumatoid arthritis [ 3 ] , and Wegener's granulomatosis [ 4 ] . Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies have <b>shown</b> that there was heterogeneity of reactivity among AGA [ 5 ] .

Both precursor and effector cells of this activity were typically NK cells [ 11 ] . Direct evidence that NK cells are the mediators of LAK activity came from Immunotransmission Electron microscopic studies using colloidal gold labeled antibodies in which CD16 positive cells were <b>shown</b> to extend their protrusions deep into the target cells and it was found that the cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles of CD16 positive LAK cells were concentrated in the area of the binding site [ 12 ] . With the advent of flowcytometry and immunophenotyping we thought we could approach this dilemma in a different but simple and straightforward manner.

We rank ACP1/ACP2 and Sparc/osteonectin as having the 9th and 23rd strongest strain differences, respectively (both ACP1/ACP2 and Sparc/osteonectin are also <b>shown</b> in Figure 3).
Finally, it should be noted that a recent study using cell lines raised the possibility that SN50's action is not specific to NF-κB [ 61 62 ] . SN50 is composed of the NLS for NF-κB p50 and was believed to specifically block NF-κB p50/p65 nuclear translocation by binding the NLS receptor complex and preventing transport through the nuclear pore [ 33 34 35 ] . However, Torgerson and coworkers [ 61 ] have <b>shown</b> that SN50 treatment inhibited nuclear transport of transcription factors NFAT, AP-1, STAT1, and NF-κB at a high dose of 210 μg/ml in Junkrat cells.
As <b>shown</b> in Table 1we applied Autocorrelation, MESA and the "Chi-squared Periodogram" [ 57 ] to locomotor activity data generated by individuals who were either wild-type, cyc 01/+, cyc 02/+, or who had only one copy of the cyc locus ( cyc -deletion/+) [ 58 ] . We advocate using these methods simultaneously to maximize accuracy (for example, if Autocorrelation analysis indicates that a signal is arrhythmic we reject any value from MESA because MESA does not evaluate rhythmicity and will return an estimate for any signal).

Moreover, a comparison of the secondary structure elements derived from the reported three-dimensional model of MJ0757 [ 27] and those derived from a prediction generated using a multiple alignment query with the structure-prediction program PHD (such predictions typically exceed 70% accuracy), <b>showed</b> an overlap of just two of the 16 or so secondary structural elements (Figure 5).
In a study at Army training centers, Brundage and colleagues detected significantly higher rates of febrile respiratory illness among building occupants housed in modern barracks with low outdoor air ventilation rates as compared to soldiers housed in older barracks with higher ventilation rates [ 2 ] . In a study conducted during the Gulf War, Richards and his colleagues concluded that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in troops housed in air-conditioned barracks when compared to those that were housed in non-air-conditioned barracks, open warehouses or tents [ 3 ] . In a hospital-based study, an outbreak of varicella virus was explained by airflow studies, which demonstrated the spread of airborne virus from an infected patient housed in an isolation room to 15 other patients [ 1 ] . In a study conducted during a pneumococcal disease epidemic in a crowded jail, it was <b>shown</b> that attack rates were 95% higher in cells with the lowest volume of air supply per person [ 4 ] .

Furthermore, this supports the data <b>showing</b> that the agonist can activate signaling in Shh -/-embryos (Figure 3) and suggests that the agonist function is not only downstream of the Hh protein but also independent of the endogenous Hh-signaling modulators, Tout veloux and HIP, that act via the Hh ligand [ 2 ] . The competition experiment with forskolin <b>showed</b> identical inhibition curves for Hh protein and the agonist, strongly suggesting that the action of the small molecule is upstream of the protein-kinase-A-sensitive step in the pathway.
Some of the fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which contract to close the wound [ 4 14 15 ] . Myofibroblasts are fibrogenic, <b>showing</b> elevated expression of interstitial collagens, laminin, FN and TN, and inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases such as TIMP-1 [ 15 16 17 18 19 ] . Because cCAF is expressed highly in the granulation tissue of wounds in areas where ECM is abundant [ 3 6 11 ] , and it stimulates fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts [ 4 ] , we investigated whether this chemokine stimulates the production of the four major ECM molecules mentioned above, interstitial Colls I and III, TN and cellular FN.

Prior studies have <b>shown</b> variability in the use of therapeutic modalities (including PACs, ventilator, and intravenous vasoactive and inotropic agents) among ICU patients [ 21 27 ] and different impacts on outcomes and use of hospital resources associated with these treatments [ 16 17 18 28 29 ] . In general, with the exception of the recent trial demonstrating benefit of early goal-directed treatment involving oxygenation (including ventilatory support if necessary) and blood pressure (including intravenous pressors if necessary) [ 30 ] , few data are available that demonstrate that these modalities improve outcomes.
Figure 2<b>shows</b> fluorescence micrographs and bar graphs of the positions of the ALMs from strain TU2562, which has an integrated mec-3gfp (equivalent to pJC8 in Figure 4), and strain EA485, which contains a high copy extrachromosomal array made from plasmid pJC4 (see Figure 4and Materials and Methods).
Figure 1<b>shows</b> the number of antibiotics prescribed during the period of hospital stay.
Cross-validation experiments in which only a subset of promoters was used suggest that additional sequences similar to those in the current set of 1,841 would not further improve the results significantly (data not <b>shown</b>).
These estimated incidence rates are <b>shown</b> in table 2. As a conservative estimate for relative risk calculations, all the rates were pooled (as the unweighted mean of the calculated rates in table 2for men and women), recognizing that this will yield a higher "unexposed" rate than was likely present for the younger and predominantly female populations exposed to the anorexic drugs.
In addition, other recent studies have <b>shown</b> that the membrane phospholipid phosohatidylinositol-4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP 2 ) reduces sensitivity of K ATP to ATP, and therefore, activates K ATP [ 32 33 34 ] . To our knowledge, this is the first report of regulation of K ATP activity by phorbol ester in rat β-cells.
It is, however, worth noting that the activity of two of the proteins in this category (AtPLC1 and KCO1) has been <b>shown</b> to be dependent on Ca 2+[ 31, 42].

They are identical to Tables 1, 2 and 3 respectively, except that the total annual volumes in Tables 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced with per-household annual volumes in Tables 4, 5 and 6. A comparison of figures in Tables 4, 5, and 6 with the corresponding figures in Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively, <b>shows</b> that the replacement of total by per-household volume figures leaves the shares of sectors and uses in total First-Class Mail volume unchanged.
Depending on the electrophoresis condition, one narrow band, a pair of two bands or one very broad band was observed (data not <b>shown</b>).
Thymocytes in the adult Rag1 -/-thymus have been previously <b>shown</b> to have overall lower levels of proliferation than adult wild type TN thymocytes [ 13 ] , particularly at the TN3 stage [ 37 38 39 40 ] .

The orfs adjacent to cg4715 (two upstream and two downstream) appear to be non-homologous to retrovirus orfs (data not <b>shown</b>) suggesting that it may either be an insect gene or a remnant of an integrated retroelement.
One mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction is through cytokine production or induction [ 1 ] . Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), constitutively produced by many NSCLC has been identified as one factor that has direct immunosuppressive properties and is <b>known</b> to induce IL10 in mononuclear cells [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . IL10 is a dominant immunosuppressive cytokine found in the NSCLC environment <b>known</b> to directly affect T cell-mediated immunity [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Both PGE-2 and IL10 have been <b>shown</b> to suppress antigen presentation, to suppress cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses, and to inhibit cytokine production by T cells and antigen presenting cells, perhaps most importantly IL12, that plays a central role in initiation and potentiation of cellular immune responses [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] , [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ] . We asked whether PGE-2 levels and/or IL10 levels were elevated in plasma of NSCLC patients, whether monocytes from NSCLC patients produce more IL10 than normals, and whether there was correlation within our findings.

It has also been <b>shown</b> that aspirin inhibited nitrosamine induced lung carcinogenesis [ 27 ] , and it reduced COX-2 enzyme levels in lung cancer cell lines [ 28 ] . Further support for a potential role of the COX-2 pathway in lung cancer development comes from several investigations that demonstrated COX-2 overexpression in human lung tumors, specifically NSCLC [ 29 30 31 32 ] and precursor lesions [ 33 ] . While COX-2 expression was generally <b>shown</b> to be increased in NSCLC and to a much lesser extent in SCLC, the role of COX-2 expression in latter tumor type is difficult to determine, due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC tumors examined in these studies was very small.
