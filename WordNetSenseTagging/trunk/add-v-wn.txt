SLC/CCL21, a CC chemokine expressed in high endothelial venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes, strongly attracts naive T cells and DCs [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] .

Initial results showed that CAR is an apparently constitutive transactivator able to activate gene expression in the absence of exogenously <b>added</b> ligands [ 8 9 ] . The first CAR ligands identified, androstanol and androstenol, are inverse agonists that block this constitutive transactivation [ 10 ] . More recently, it has been found that CAR mediates the characteristic response of a subset of drug metabolizing enzymes to a variety of structurally unrelated foreign compounds [ 11 ] . These xenobiotic activators are referred to as "phenobarbital (PB) - like," based on the prototypic effects of the anti-epileptic agent on drug metabolism [ 12 13 14 ] . The most potent activator of murine CAR is the high affinity agonist ligand TCPOBOP (1,4-bis [2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene) [ 15 16 ] .

The health benefits or hazards associated with fish consumption will require <b>added</b> attention to origin of fish - marine or fresh water - given the reported differences in stores of polyunsaturated fatty acids and N-3 fatty acid between the two types of fish [ 44 45 46 47 ] . Levels of N-3 fatty acids vary by fish species, oil content of fish, sex and age of fish, and factors exogenous to fish such as water temperature [ 47 48 ] . Oily fish from cold waters (whether marine or fresh bodies of water) are reported to have higher levels of N-3 fatty acids in comparison to fish from warmer bodies [ 45 47 ] . The ratio of N-3 to N-6 fatty acids has recently been suggested as being associated with gestation and birth weight [ 49 ] and this ratio is approximately four-times greater in marine fish in comparison to fresh water fish [ 45 ] . Type and species-specific fish consumption will remain important considerations in assessing exposure scenarios based on fish consumption.

Interestingly, phages have been shown to carry ORFs named 'morons' (because they <b>add</b> more DNA to the phage genome), which often have unknown functions, but are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host when the prophage is integrated in its genome [ 22 ] . These genes undergo high mutation and nonhomologous recombination rates, and often display high A+T-content, even in comparison to the phage itself [ 22 23 ] . Most LTGs fit this description and may therefore have been introduced into the genome by phages.
