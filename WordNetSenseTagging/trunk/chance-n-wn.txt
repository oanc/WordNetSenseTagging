Single nucleotide discrimination is achieved at the ligation step by the use of the thermostable DNA ligase, Ampligase, which has a high affinity for a perfectly matched substrate at the 3' end of a DNA molecule [ 17 ] . We were able to enhance allele discrimination at the ligation step by designing the OCP such that the 5' complementary region is firmly hybridized to the target sequence whereas the 3' region is in equilibrium with its target at the ligation temperature [ 12 ] . This would result in increased specificity since the correctly matched OCP will have a greater <b>chance</b> to act as substrate for the ligase.
