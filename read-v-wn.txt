In C. elegans , two genes each encode unusual bifunctional enzymes containing both isocitrate lyase and malate synthase domains [ 49 ] . Since the isocitrate lyase domain lies within the amino-terminal half of the C. elegans bifunctional enzyme and none of the Meloidogyne EST <b>reads</b> stretches across both domains, further sequencing of the 3' end of cDNA clones from the M. hapla or M. javanica isocitrate lyase ESTs will be necessary to determine whether the Meloidogyne genus contains a bifunctional glyoxylate enzyme homolog similar to that of
