Protein phosphatase 5 has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation, in hormonal signal transduction, and in hsp90 chaperone function [ 3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ] . However little is <b>known</b> about the regulation of PP5 or its specific role in these pathways, and only one physiological substrate for PP5 has been identified to date, the apoptosis signaling kinase ASK 1 [ 13 ] . PP5 can be activated by lipid in vitro , and removal of the TPR domain or the C terminus generates an active, lipid insensitive form of the enzyme [ 18 19 20 21 ] . PP5 phosphatase activity is also altered by hCRY2 and a fragment of hsp90 in vitro [ 21 22 ] . These findings suggest that PP5 may be autoinhibited and that the binding of protein partners or lipids to the TPR domain could potentially control PP5 activity in cells, however no reports have yet documented how PP5 is regulated in vivo . The activity of PP5 homologs from cauliflower, T. brucei and P. falciparum is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro [ 7 8 9 10 ] and removal of the TPR domain from P. falciparum PP5 increases activity to the same extent as lipid treatment [ 8 9 ] . This suggests that the TPR domain plays a similar inhibitory role for all PP5 homologs.

COX-2 is an inducible enzyme upregulated in inflammatory states [ 20 21 ] . Notably, many NSCLC and what have been characterized as "premalignant" lung lesions have been <b>shown</b> to constitutively express the COX-2 enzyme and produce prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), the primary product of the COX-2 pathway [ 22 23 24 25 26 ] . Importantly, PGE-2 production by tumor cells has been linked to tumor-induced immunosuppression in NSCLC [ 2 3 4 5 ] . PGE-2 has been <b>shown</b> to directly suppress T cell mediated immunity, the primary effector against tumor cells, at a variety of levels [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . Further, PGE-2 has been <b>shown</b> to induce the IL10 in mononuclear cells [ 4 5 ] . IL10 is a prominent immunosuppressive cytokine that may have a dominant role in preventing innate antitumor responses in the NSCLC environment [ 2 3 4 5 ] , [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ] . Among myriad suppressive effects on T cells and antigen presenting cells, IL10 is <b>known</b> to inhibit IL12 production [ 14 15 16 17 18 ] . IL12 plays a key role in the initiation and potentiation of cellular immune responses and alteration of the IL12 producing function in circulating mononuclear phagocytes may be a critical factor in suppressed T cell immunity to NSCLC [ 27 28 ] .
