Such therapy appears to be cost effective [ 15 16 ] , especially among high risk patients and is recommended under current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [ 17 ] . Fourth, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels.
Even if these findings are not confirmed after further study, one could still make a compelling argument that lipid-lowering therapy (barring contraindications) should be initiated early and universally in patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome: First, the long-term safety and effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is well-established [ 1 2 3 ] ; Second, as evidenced by MIRACL, these agents are safe when initiated at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome; Third, the in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering therapy appears to promote greater long-term utilization of these agents [ 18 19 20 21 ] . Finally, although lipid levels may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (excepting total :HDL and LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios [ 22 ] ) the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions to attain recommended cholesterol targets [ 23 24 25 ] ; newer guidelines are even more stringent [ 26 ] . Furthermore, data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ] . Thus, to withhold lipid-lowering therapy from patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo, and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal [ 27 28 ] .

The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.

The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules.

Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between the 2 minutes clinicians typically allot to seeking evidence [ 2 ] and the amount of time needed to search MEDLINE [ 4 12 13 ] . Indeed, "some have likened MEDLINE searching to attempting to drink water from a fire hose" [ 15 ] . Although MEDLINE is certainly more difficult to search than other resources recommended for evidence-based medicine, the other resources, in aggregate, probably require excessive time to search if they are searched in sequence as recommended.

Further work is needed to help physicians to understand their patients' views on hepatitis C. A recent study showed that persons with hepatitis C preferred to expedite periods of poor health, implying that they may be more likely to proceed with antiviral therapy and its attendant side effects than to delay treatment [ 19 ] . In contrast, the physicians in the current survey had a relatively high threshold for recommending treatment, which would lead them to postpone therapy in the majority of cases.

Finally, although lipid levels may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (excepting total :HDL and LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios [ 22 ] ) the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions to attain recommended cholesterol targets [ 23 24 25 ] ; newer guidelines are even more stringent [ 26 ] . Furthermore, data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ] . Thus, to withhold lipid-lowering therapy from patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo, and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal [ 27 28 ] .
In the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI), peripheral alpha-1 antagonists are recommended not only as second-line anti-hypertensive therapy after low-dose diuretics and beta blockers, but also for specific indications such as therapy in men with hypertension and prostatism [ 2 ] . Alpha-1 antagonists represent effective therapy for prostatism, and fifty percent of men have histologic evidence of BPH by 60 years of age [ 3 4 ] . The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey reported that the number of people on any type of peripheral alpha-1 antagonist in 1995 was approximately 6 to 7% of those with hypertension [ 5 ] . About 80% of surveyed physicians would choose these drugs as a first-line blood pressure agent for patients with hypertension and symptoms of BPH [ 6 ] .
Then the proteins were transferred to a membrane and Western blotting was performed using the monoclonal antibody for PAC-1 and A20, followed by the ECL technique as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Further, we recommend pooling RNA samples instead of tissue or cell samples, because the variability at the tissue level is usually larger than at the RNA level.
The chips were incubated (16-17 hours, 45Â°C and 60 rpm) in a rotating oven, washed by the Affymetrix Fluidics Station, using the recommended signal amplification step, and scanned by the Affymetrix Scanner.
In those cases, or more generally, we recommend calculating the bootstrap 95% confidence interval (range).
Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors, using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) for 293 cells or Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 3T3 cells, according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturers.
The importance of replication in microarray gene expression studies has been addressed by Lee [ 8 ] . These authors concluded that more reliable analyses of gene expression data are obtained by pooling data from multiple replicates, and recommended that at least three replicate hybridisations be completed for each experimental treatment.
Total RNA was then obtained from the homogenate by the procedure recommended by the reagent's supplier (TRI-reagent, Sigma #T9424).
It is also comparable to other RNA amplification methods, such as antisense RNA amplification where 0.25 - 3.0 Î¼g of total RNA is required [ 14 ] and Amine-modified random primer where 1.0 Î¼g of total RNA is required [ 15 ] . 20-30 PCR cycles are recommended since too few cycles will reduce the difference between the exponentially amplified tester or control DNA and the linearly amplified hybrid DNA and too many cycles will saturate abundant genes.
3 years) used in this study had a CD4 +T cell count from 210-500 cells/mm 3and fell in the A2 and B2 classification recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.
This procedure recovered >95% of control protein from SDS sample buffer over the range of protein concentrations recommended for use in the BCA assay (data not shown).
Mouse osteoblasts were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates until they were confluent; they were then fixed and permeabilized using CytoFix/CytoPerm according to the methods recommended by the manufacturer (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.).
We recommend limiting the total study duration to not more than two years, recognizing there may be exceptions due to patient accrual rate, intervention, and outcome.
We recommend that a meta-analysis be as inclusive as possible, e.g., you may exclude studies in children if they are known to be different from adults, but all studies in adults should be included without regard to age or gender.
For the later, we recommend that investigators seek the support of the institutional librarians.
We recommend that both the score based on items and the summary score be computed.
We strongly recommend pilot testing the data abstraction form on a few studies before defining a final format.
We recommend that the investigator compute this value and include the results in the interpretation of the findings.
Because the underlying prevalence of cancer is so low in average risk populations, for acceptable cancer screening of asymptomatic people, the FPR should be very small [ 9 ] . As a starting point we recommend basing guidelines for FPR and TPR on the FPR and TPR for mammography, which, as discussed below, is FPR=.
Some investigators are now recommending that lower PSA cutpoints should be used as an indication for prostate biopsy [ 37 38 39 ] . Catalona and colleagues detected cancer in 22% of men biopsied with PSA levels between 2.6 to 4 ng/ml [ 37 ] and Lodding and colleagues detected cancers in 13% of men with PSA values between 3 to 4 ng/ml [ 39 ] . We found that lowering the cutpoint to 2 ng/ml, while greatly increasing sensitivity, led to an 80% false positive rate.
Utility analysis provides a means to quantify preference values about disease states [ 13 14 ] . The aims of the study were: 1) to assess whether physicians could provide utilities for hepatitis C health state constructs using visual analog scales, 2) to quantify physicians' judgments about various hepatitis C health states, and 3) to assess physicians' thresholds for recommending treatment.
After considering the HCV health states and the side effects of therapy, physicians indicated that they would require a median of a 60% sustained response rate (interquartile range 40%-80%) before recommending treatment.
However, ratings of side effects were not significantly correlated with thresholds for recommending therapy, suggesting that additional factors effect physicians views about antiviral therapy.
Based on the experiences of the pilot states, the recommended approaches to facilitating partnerships are to: 1) form an advisory or steering committee of partners that meets regularly (e.g.
The doses of deferiprone - even in the optimal dose group - are relatively low, compared to the desferrioxamine doses, which in most studies are well above the recommended 40 mg/kg/day.
Sequencing reactions were carried out using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit as recommended by manufacturer (Applied Biosystems).
However, in a small percentage of patients currently recommended doses may still result in toxicity.
Because of significant morbidity associated with the procedure, regional lymphadenectomy has been generally recommended only for patients with evidence of regional lymph node involvement [ 1 ] . To assess the involvement of regional lymph nodes, the biopsies of sentinel lymph nodes are invaluable for detecting occult metastases without the significant morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ] . Previous studies have reported that the status of sentinel lymph node is an accurate reflection of the regional lymph node status as a whole and that treatment decisions can be made based on the results of sentinel lymph nodes alone [ 9 10 11 ] .
In general, the standard RNA processing and hybridization protocols as recommended by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) were followed in this study; these protocols are available in the Genechip Â®Expression Analysis Technical Manual.
Breastfeeding is associated with a lower incidence of infant diarrhoea and respiratory disease, particularly in less developed countries [ 1 ] . A recent ecological study on breastfeeding showed that more than half of all infant deaths from diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections in Latin America are preventable by exclusive breastfeeding in infants aged 0-3 months and partial breastfeeding throughout the remainder of infancy [ 2 ] . The theoretical basis for this may be a combination of the nutritional and immunomodulatory effects of human milk [ 3 ] . Since 2001, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to the age of 6 months (World Health Assembly Resolution 55.
In such cases, we recommend that users assign the mean of the z-values crossed by the single birth weight.
Accompanied by explicit advice to avoid alcohol, maintain good hydration, and use co-medications with caution, we believe that prophylactic mefloquine could be recommended to certain occupational subsets of travellers who carry out safety-critical tasks and who until now have been denied the use of this drug.
Rectangular cages are not normally recommended for laparascopic insertion.
Psychiatric evaluations were recommended a) for all patients who reported current depression; b) for patients who scored 8 or higher on the aBDI at the time of their initial appointment.
The mixed opioid agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, and dezocine are not recommended as routine analgesics.
They recently developed guidelines ("Protocol Formats") on how to perform high quality validity and reliability studies of spinal palpatory procedures, which are available on their web site [ 9 ] . They recommend the use of valid palpatory tests so that homogeneous populations with spinal musculoskeletal dysfunction can be selected and treated as part of a controlled clinical trial.
We also recommended searching MEDLINE for additional systematic reviews and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse for selected practice guidelines based on systematic literature review (e.g.
All strategies recommend starting a search by seeking individual documents, whether the document is a study, a secondary publication of a single study, or a systematic review.
Finally, providers were asked to indicate on a 4-point Likert scale if they would recommend that the patient take lipid-lowering therapy, with responses ranging from "strongly recommend therapy" to "strongly recommend against therapy".
Cardiologists recommended treatment more often than generalists, even though they perceived the benefit to be smaller.
SMBG frequency was well below recommended guidelines for both insulin and sulfonylurea patients (Table 2).

The prices paid by the mystery shoppers for treating their child's malaria as recommended by outlet attendants varied widely, from about $0.
Also, epidemiological studies suggest that the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower coronary heart disease risk, especially through the reduction of blood pressures, body mass index, and levels of several thrombogenic factors [ 12 13 18 19 ] . Recently, the findings from the Lyon Diet Heart study illustrate the potential importance of the Mediterranean dietary pattern, especially when compared to other recommended diets, like Step-I diet [ 19 ] . Also, results from a Spanish Study suggest that the monounsaturated fatty acids diets are associated with a significant reduction and a better control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [ 20 ] . However it still remains a matter of debate if the protective influence is primarily caused by single nutrients, e.g. dietary fatty acids, potassium or dietary fibre or if it can be attributed to the Mediterranean diet as a whole [ 12 ] .
Further examinations including mobile phones operating in this frequency band are recommended.
Cross-case analysis included the summary of findings by analytic categories and the culling of salient commonalities, differences, and findings perceived as useful for further study and/or recommended implementation.

For all three antigens, Newkirk et al . used EIA assays and established their negative/positive cutoff value using the mean plus two standard deviations of 15 CMV seronegative sera [ 14 ] . This appears to have resulted in a negative/positive cutoff value significantly lower than that observed in the present study using either the manufacturer's recommended cutoff value or our own cutoff value established with the 40 seronegative sera.
However, the therapy groups analyzed in the present study are small, and therefore we recommend careful interpretation of the findings.
The assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics, Herlev, Denmark).
Digestion enzymes recommended for antigen retrieval were bought from Sigma (St Louis, MO).
Virtually all studies have used hydration (usually with 0.45% saline) in addition to the agent being tested and most authors recommend its use.
For this reason, the international literature recommends that vancomycin be infused over a period of 60 min in order to prevent these side effects, and hypotension in particular, which in some cases manifests as life-threatening shock [ 6, 8, 9, 16].
Largely inappropriate use of colloids was found in a survey of academic health centers despite guidelines from a US hospital consortium recommending that colloids be used in hemorrhagic shock only until blood products become available, and in nonhemorrhagic shock only if an initial infusion with crystalloid is insufficient [ 32 33 ] . A recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing colloids and crystalloid solutions for volume replacement found that resuscitation with colloids in critically ill patients was actually associated with an increased risk of mortality [ 10 ] .
â¢ Promotility agents are recommended in patients with high gastric residuals
The dosage of colistin used in our study was more than double that usually recommended [ 9 10 12 ] , although much higher doses - with a parallel increase in nephrotoxicity - have been reported in the past [ 23 ] . We opted for the higher dose because of the severity of the infections being treated.
The use of such slides is highly recommended, as it ensures that hybridizations with different RNA populations can be identified quickly and linked unambiguously to subsequent image and data analysis.

2. Where state regulations prohibit importation or use of the recommended test species, permission must be requested from the appropriate state agency prior to their use.
Where states have developed culturing and testing methods for indigenous species other than those recommended in this manual, data comparing the sensitivity of the substitute species and one or more of the recommended species must be obtained in side-by-side toxicity tests with reference toxicants and/or effluents, to ensure that the species selected are at least as sensitive as the recommended species.
If the acclimation process is repeated with a new group of test organisms and excessive mortality occurs, it is recommended that an alternative source of dilution water be used.
It is recommended that personnel collecting samples and performing toxicity tests not work alone.
As a result of the variability of different dilution factors, USEPA recommends the use of the dilution factor of 0.5 or greater.
Where states have developed culturing and testing methods for indigenous species other than those recommended in this manual, data comparing the sensitivity of the substitute species and the one or more recommended species must be obtained in side-by-side toxicity tests with reference toxicants and/or effluents, to ensure that the species selected are at least as sensitive as the recommended species.

If, as we recommend, there is substantial change in the way we collect and share intelligence, there should be a voice within the executive branch for those concerns.
We further recommend that federal homeland security funds be allocated in accordance with those benchmarks, and that states be required to abide by those benchmarks in disbursing the federal funds.
Despite examples of terrorists entering from Canada, awareness of terrorist activity in Canada and its more lenient immigration laws, and an inspector general's report recommending that the Border Patrol develop a northern border strategy, the only positive step was that the number of Border Patrol agents was not cut any further.
Though the principals hoped that the missiles would hit Bin Ladin, NSC staff recommended the strike whether or not there was firm evidence that the commanders were at the facilities.
Binalshibh also researched flight schools in Europe, and in the Netherlands he met a flight school director who recommended flight schools in the United States because they were less expensive and required shorter training periods.
The Port Authority recommended leaving the repeater system on at all times.
Such therapy appears to be cost effective [ 15 16 ] , especially among high risk patients and is recommended under current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [ 17 ] . Fourth, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels.
As has been noted in the ICH-E9 guideline [ 9 ] , 'no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended.
Caveat: it is always recommended that the results between two BLAST matches be scrutinized as reports have suggested that the closest BLAST match is often not the nearest neighbor [ 30 ] .
After the recommended normalization procedure was applied, we confirmed that there was negligible inter-array variability of the mean signal (with 5% of signals trimmed from both the high and low ends) across the 4629 targets that passed the presence / absence filter (described in the next section).
Total RNA was extracted from normal human skeletal muscle tissue samples and used for cDNA and labeled cRNA synthesis as previously described [ 14 15 ] . The fragmented cRNA together with control targets recommended by Affymetrix were hybridized to the GeneChip of choice (HuGeneFL or HG-U95A).
However, a simpler method, and one that we recommend, is to estimate the bootstrap 95% confidence interval (range) and/or bootstrap standard error of the mode.
We recommend that experimentalists perform both a single marker analysis with an intersection test and a multiple marker analysis and use the information available in both analyses to guide their decisions about what regions to carry forward for further study.

We strongly recommend the use of a numeric quality score to summarize the results of the evaluation [ 5 20 22 24 ] . The two blinded raters will create a consensus score for quality which will be combined with the score for sources from the unblinded raters to give a final score for the study.
Petitti [ 31 ] has observed that this test is conservative, and we recommend that the significance level for this statistic be set to 0.10 rather than the usual 0.05.
We also recommend that all deaths and their causes be reported.
The most effective screening test is the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay, which in combination with digital rectal examination (DRE) substantially enhances the cancer detection rate [ 4 ] . The American Cancer Society and the American Urologic Association recommend annual cancer screening with PSA testing and digital rectal examination for men with life expectancies greater than 10 years [ 5 6 ] . However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Physicians have not endorsed routine screening because there is no conclusive evidence that screening and treatment reduce morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer [ 7 8 ] . Another concern about prostate cancer screening is uncertainty about the diagnostic performance of PSA.

Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between the 2 minutes clinicians typically allot to seeking evidence [ 2 ] and the amount of time needed to search MEDLINE [ 4 12 13 ] . Indeed, "some have likened MEDLINE searching to attempting to drink water from a fire hose" [ 15 ] . Although MEDLINE is certainly more difficult to search than other resources recommended for evidence-based medicine, the other resources, in aggregate, probably require excessive time to search if they are searched in sequence as recommended.
Finally, providers were asked to indicate on a 4-point Likert scale if they would recommend that the patient take lipid-lowering therapy, with responses ranging from "strongly recommend therapy" to "strongly recommend against therapy".
Perhaps because of the over-estimation of risk and the potential benefits of treatment, most physicians recommended treatment in most scenarios, even those with relatively low risk.
Cut points for regular use were based on dispensing patterns and recent guidelines recommending testing three to four times per day for insulin users and less frequent testing for non-insulin users.

Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, except for MCF10A cells, which were grown as recommended by the ATCC.
The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HCC1954 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown under the recommended conditions.
Then, each antibody was tested with our published protocol, which involves an overnight incubation of deparaffinized sections at 70Â°C in the retrieval solution and an incubation for 3-4 hours or overnight of the primary antibody at about 25Â°C [ 26 ] . Two adjacent sections stained by using our protocol and the manufacturer's recommended protocols were compared for specificity and sensitivity.
